Travis CI Jython template
=========================

`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_ template to use Jython similar
as to using a separate Python version. Currently Travis CI doesn't
directly support Jython like other Python versions.

This project contains a ``.travis.yml`` that you can use as a template
for setting up Jython only or Python and Jython matrix builds. It also
allows you to easily use external jars from maven repository.
